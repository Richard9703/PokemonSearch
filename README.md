# PokemonSearch
## About 
The website is a simple Pok√©mon search. It will show the pokemon image, name, ability and weight. I am using Poke API to get the data that I am using for the website. 

## Build
I wanted to make a search/filter. I looked at a few APIs to use which would allow me to create what I wanted. I used a variety of APIs to test such as Studio Ghibli API, Animal Crossing: NH API and an Anime/Manga list API. 

## Features 
When you first open the website. You will be greeted with the navbar and a search bar. There will be an instruction on how to use the website.

![New Wireframe 1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91730394/148729658-4f28c8ea-6372-46ba-b4a4-755921c216a2.png)

## About 
The website is a simple Pok√©mon search. It will show the pokemon image, name, ability and weight. I am using Poke API to get the data that I am using for the website. 

## Build
I wanted to make a search/filter. I looked at a few APIs to use which would allow me to create what I wanted. I used a variety of APIs to test such as Studio Ghibli API, Animal Crossing: NH API and an Anime/Manga list API. 

## Current Features 
### Navbar
- The navbar is a simple design. I took a pokeball png and added it to the left-hand side. The links dont go anywhere at the moment but if you click on them. They will open the web page in a new tab.

### Main Page
- The main page contains a search bear and an empty content area. Users will just need to follow the instructions above the search bar.

### Using the "search bar"
- Once users type into the search bar a pokemon that they prefer. It will post an image on the page.

- Then if you hover over the image you will see the information regarding to the pokemon that you searched for!

### Footer 
- The footer at the very bottom is a standard footer that leads to blank links with my name and copyright icon.

### Future Features 
- I would like to add more filters in the search engine such as searching by type, size, weight etc..
- Show the evolutions of each pokemon (that are able to evolve) and how to evolve them.
- Add a region map based on the pokemon where you will be able to interact and mark items, gyms etc. on the map depending on your progression.

## Testing 
### Nav
- Navbar is responsive in 4 all screen sizes except for 'Galaxy Fold'.
- Hamburger icon appears when screen size is below 820px. 
- When you click the icon it will have a dropdown menu.
- The links are empty at the moment and they will only open new tabs of the website.

### Search Bar
- Able to input text in the search bar.
- When you click the search icon or press enter. It will look for the pokemon.
- At lower screen sizes the search bar adjusts in size.
- When the image appears. You can hover over it and it will reveal information about the pokemon.

### Footer 
- The social media links are responsive.
- The links will open a new tab to their direct websites.
